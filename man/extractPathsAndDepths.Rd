\title{Extract Paths and Depths from a Nested List}
\usage{
extractPathsAndDepths(nestedList, currentPath = "", depth = 1, item = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{nestedList}{A nested list object from which to extract paths and depths.}

\item{currentPath}{A character string representing the current path during recursion.
Defaults to an empty string. This parameter is primarily used internally by the function.}

\item{depth}{An integer representing the current depth of the recursion.
Defaults to 1. This parameter is primarily used internally by the function.}

\item{item}{An optional character string specifying the name of the item to look for.
If provided, the function will return only the paths and depths for elements
matching this name. If \code{NULL}, all elements are included. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A named list where each name represents the path to an element,
and each value represents the depth of that element within the nested structure.
}
\description{
This function recursively traverses a nested list in R and returns the paths
and depths of each element. Optionally, you can filter the results to only
include elements with a specific name. Unnamed elements are represented by
a special character "_".
